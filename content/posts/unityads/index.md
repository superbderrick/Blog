I am using google mediaion for monetization for app in company, Recently I have new requirment to add new ads network for Unity Ads network

Like a normal ads network, I just intergated adpater sdk and enabled for unity ads in Unity Editor 

but when build from xcode met a build error about UnityMonetizaion h header not found problem

It has to install another unity package which is iOS 14 Advertising Support package not normall unity ads package..
