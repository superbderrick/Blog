Hi There,

Today I am going to share how to test ARfoundation sample code by unity

AR Foundation enables you to create multi-platform augmented reality (AR) apps with Unity and it can use All AR features of each platform can be used with one code iOS ARKit and Google AR Core

Detail below link

https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@5.0/manual/index.html

 

First you can clone AR foundation sample code from github

https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples

 
Secondly you can should check what version do you use unity editor, because AR foundation sample provides each editor version's sample using branch

for me I am using 2020.3.43f1 Editor and checkout 4.1 branch, mostly main branch using  AR Foundation 5.1 version it can support Unity 2021.2 and later version 

AR Foundation Version defend on unity editor version

    2023.1 (alpha)	5.1 (prerelease)
    2022.2 (beta)	5.0 (release)
    2022.1	5.0 (release)
    2021.3	4.2 (release)
    2020.3	4.1 (release)
 
 After checkout branch for each unity editor version and open the sample project
