It is not easy to change char value or update or remove in string when we use a c# language

It's good with Stringbuilder for that

While I was solving the problem below from programmars, there are requirement to change to capital charcter
Firstly I tried to change with normal c sharp string api but not was easy

I got a hint from goole, realized string builder advantages.

it's easy to change char in string. let 's use string builder and see the offical doc
